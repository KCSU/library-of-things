        Since you are able to see this page, you must already be an
        administrator and should have access to the admin sidebar on the left.
        To assign administrator privileges to other users, please contact
        the computing officer (for now).
      </p>
      <p class="mb-3">
        Under "Item Requests", you will see all pending requests from users to
        borrow items. For each loan, you can either confirm item delivery (which
        will start the timer for the loan) or refuse the request.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-3">
        Under "Manage Inventory", you will see a list of all items. You can
        add new items, and also delete and edit existing items. Notably, you can
        also hide items, which makes them invisible to regular users but still
        visible in the admin inventory.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-3">
        For each item, you can choose from a pre-determined set of loan
        durations (7 days / 30 days / end of academic year / permanent). This
        determines how long an item can be borrowed for. "End of academic year"
        here means the next 30th June, while "permanent" here means the item
        will be given away, permanently.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-3">
        You can also put out public announcements that will be displayed on the
        homepage for all users to see. You can do this in the "Settings" section.

        This most likely means that they are not registered as a user on the website;
        you can verify this by checking the "User List" section in the admin sidebar.
        The list shows all users (including undergraduates and postgraduates) who
        are allowed to access the Library. If you wish to modify the list, please contact
        Lucas for now, while he looks for a better solution.

        If not, please obtain access from the computing officer.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-3">
        Upload the image to the folder, right-click on it, and select "Copy Link".
        The image should be publicly viewable. The link should be of the form
      </p>
      <pre class="text-center my-6 text-sm">https://drive.google.com/file/d/<b class="text-red-400">&lt;image_id&gt;</b>/view<b class="text-gray-500">[?...]</b></pre>
      <p class="mb-3">Copy the image ID, then paste it inside the following URL template:</p>
      <pre class="text-center my-6 text-sm">https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/<b class="text-red-400">&lt;image_id&gt;</b></pre>
      <p class="mb-3">You can then use this URL as the image URL when adding or editing items in the inventory.</p>
      <p class="mb-3">This is a temporary solution. If this proves to be too much of a hassle, Lucas is open to suggestions for improvement.</p>
